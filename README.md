# EDA-of-Covid-19-cases-in-SKorea
As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads through out the world, I tried to do my part of exploring the data which contains the cases form South Korea.
## The Dataset
The dataset I took is from DS4C Covid-19 for cases. Which included:
1. CaseID: which is connected to other dataset to show relation.
2. Province: Special and Metropolitan cities
3. City: Different cities which are affected locally. The '-' value in the city means that the particular case is not locally transmitted.
4. Group: Contains Boolean data, 'True'means the cases is locally transmitted, otherwise 'False'.
5. Infection_case: The reason of the spread.
6. Confirmed: Number of confirmed cases
7. Latitude and Longitudes: Coordinates of the city which has local transmission.

### Current status: EDA of only cases dataset is completed, 6 more datasets are remaining.
